# DMPy: A DMP python library that implements the DMP in SE(3) 

In this library the Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) model for the pose of the robot's end-effector is implented. The developed code is based on the simple DMP model provided in:

The research project "CARPOS - Coachable Robot for Fruit Picking Operations" is implemented in the framework of H.F.R.I call "Basic Research Financing (Horizontal support of all Sciences)" under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan "Greece 2.0" funded by the European Union – NextGenerationEU(H.F.R.I. Project Number: 16523).
